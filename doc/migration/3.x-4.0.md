Fenix 4.0.0

### Pre-Migration

1. Run the follwing script to ensure proper initialization of UserProfiles and LoginPeriods: (BootstrapProfiles.java)[https://gist.github.com/pedrosan7os/15d5419e50c1f05eb6c3]

2. Roles are no more. To ensure that previously existing roles are migrated to the new group-based method, you should create Dynamic Groups with the appropriate people. You can find an example script (here)[https://gist.github.com/jcarvalho/6164da7acaf223e653c4].

3. Make sure you remove any Functionalities that point to removed roles (such as WEBSITE_MANAGER).
